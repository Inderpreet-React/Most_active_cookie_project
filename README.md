Solution
I have used Python script to accomplish the task.
Dependencies
•	Python 3.x

Create a file, say 
most_active_cookie.py


How to Run the Script
$ python most_active_cookie.py -f cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09

Testing
For testing, I have used Python's unit test framework. It includes test cases for:
•	Extracting cookie data for a given date.
•	Identifying the most active cookies.
Create a file, say 
test_most_active_cookie.py:

To run the tests, execute:
$ python test_most_active_cookie.py
